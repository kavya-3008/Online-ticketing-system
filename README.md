# I am developing an Autograder program that manages a tutor help queue, just like the one we use in class when we need help during office hours to submit a support ticket. This program is the simpler version of Autograder you have been using. It has the following three components:
● Part 1: Class Ticket - represent properties of a support ticket
● Part 2: Class Queue - represents a queue of tickets
● Part 3: Class Autograder - represents a simplified autograder system where tickets can
be submitted to the queue of a course
